## Assignment overview
Cognitive science revealed that humans learn to recognize object categories ceaselessly over time. This ability allowsthem to adapt to new environments,  by enhancing their knowledge from the accumulation of experiences and theconceptualization of new object categories. Takin. In particular, the agent can interact with the g this theory as an inspiration, we seek to create an interactive objectrecognition system that can learn 3D object categories in an open-ended fashion. In this project, “open-ended” implies thatthe set of categories to be learned is not known in advance. The training instances are extracted from on-line experiencesof a robot, and thus become gradually available over time, rather than being completely available at the beginning of thelearning process.Your  goal  for  this  assignment  is  to  implement  an  open-ended  learning  approach for 3D object recognition. 

We break this assignment down into two parts:
1. The first part is about implementing/optimizing offline 3D object recognition systems, which take an object view as input and produces the category label as output (e.g., apple, mug, fork, etc).

2. The second part of this assignment is dedicated to testing your approach in an open-ended fashion.In this assignment, the number of categories is not pre-defined in advance and the knowledge of agent/robot is increasing over time by interacting with a simulated teacher using three actions: teach, ask, and correct (see Fig.1).
